# VTU_CG_LAB
All 9 experiments of Computer Graphics Lab, 
Prescribed by VTU of 2018 Scheme.

Most of the primary codes are in main.cpp file.
I've executed these programs in windows, hence
#include<windows.h> is in every code.
It's required only for windows.

I've used Codeblocks and setup up glut libraries 
In the codeblocks.
